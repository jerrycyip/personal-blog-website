# personal-blog-website
This project is part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.  The project is to create a personal blog website using HTML and CSS, with emphasis on employing the latest CSS Grid and Flexbox features.  In a future effort, javascript functionality may be added later, but was not part of the original scope of this project.

## Getting Started
No additional tools are required besides a web browser and text editor.  The main homepage is accessed via the index.html file with the other html "blog post" files being linked to from the main homepage.  The supporting css files are separated based on functionality (e.g. mobile responsive, navigation bar, overall layout etc).
